                <h3>Investigating Names Project</h3>
                <h4>Written September 10<sup>th</sup> 2015</h4>
                <p>
	  Mostly everyone’s names have specific origins, or historical backgrounds. My name is Christa. A lot of people confuse my name for the name “Crystal” and pronounce it with an “L” at the end. My mom chose my name when I was born without assistance, no other names were considered. According to her, she chose it because of the meaning behind it, “Christ like”. It’s funny because when I was born, my mom didn’t name me immediately. On my original birth certificate, I don’t even have a first name. But according to her, no other names were considered. My name originates from the Greek word “Christos”, meaning “anointed” or “chosen one”. My name’s use is “rare in Greece and, can be found mostly in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Germany” according to wikipedia. The name Christa is an English baby name. In English, the meaning of the name Christa is: Follower of Christ. Another meaning for my name is the Latin meaning, which is also just another baby name. My final, and personal favorite resource, is Urban Dictionary. Urban Dictionary does not tell the origin or historical background of my name, but describes a “Christa’s” personality traits. Urban Dictionary reads, “Christas are intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate, open-minded and kind. Christas are comfortable being a dork because they’re sexy as well. Christas have a natural talent for creating great food and doing all that they can to please the ones they love. Has the tendency to get a little obsessive but it’s pretty much harmless. Christas love to fall in love and need to be careful not to hurt feelings unintentionally.” I like my name, except the mispronunciation. I feel as if the meaning and descriptions fit my character very well. A lot of people ask me, “If you have another name, what name would it be?” I’ve never considered having a different name, I guess it’s because I don’t really know what name I’d rather have. I suppose it’s safe to say that, my first name is a perfect fit for me.
	As for my last name, Nicosia, it’s a little different than my first name. In my family the name Nicosia holds a lot of weight, some good, some bad, but I won’t get into that. My uncle’s used to always encourage me by saying things like “Of course you got an A, you’re a Nicosia”, or “That’s that Nicosia blood”. It always made me feel like my name was special or had a special meaning behind it. I’ve always taken pride in my last name mainly because I know that it’s unique. When people see my name for the first time, they never know what face to expect behind it. People never know what the origin of my name is, and I didn’t either until just recently. According to houseofnames.com, “Nicosia is a habitational name, taken from the name of the city of Enna in Sicily, Italy.” There are many different meanings for my last name. Seven reflections reads that if you are a Nicosia “You have a vivid imagination who can bring inspired messages to the world. You like to enjoy the pleasures of life, and when self is overcome, you can rise to the heights. You have an ability to avoid trouble - that is why you often fails to learn from experiences. You are restless, sociable people-oriented, a lover of change, and a seeker of adventure and new thrills.You are intuitive and might be interested in the arts, drama or science.” I agree with some of those traits more than others but overall I believe it’s a good description. I wouldn’t change my last name if I had the opportunity because I wouldn’t want it to be anything other that what it is. My last name is even more unique than my first name. With that being said, I believe my first and last name fit together well.

                <h3>Introduction Essay</h3>
                <h4>Written August 31<sup>st</sup> 2015</h4>
                <p>My name is Christa Nicosia. I am 18 years old. I don’t go by a nickname, just Christa I guess. I was born in Chicago, but I moved to Florida my freshman year. I am a middle child on both sides of my family. I have 3 siblings on my dad’s side and 4 on my mom’s. I have 3 brothers and 4 sisters, so I come from a decent sized family. My oldest sister is a sophomore at Mississippi Valley State University. In my spare time, I like to hoop, watch movies, listen to music, go out, and occasionally work out. 
	I have lived in an abundance of states such as Florida(9th and 10th grades), Illinois(most of my life), and Texas(8th grade). Just returning to Chicago during my junior year of high school, I have attended Providence St. Mel, Marshall Metro High School, and now Chicago Tech Academy High School. My experience back in Chicago has definitely been an interesting one.
	Coming to Chi Tech, I hope to better my education as well as gain some knowledge about technology. My personality, honestly, may vary depending on the vibe of the person addressing me. I’m not really much of a writer or reader for that matter, but I hope to learn to take a liking to both. I try to keep a positive attitude in all situations, most of the time. I plan to graduate and become a full-time college student at a 4- year university.

                <h3>Education Matters Scholarship Essay</h3>
                <h4></h4>
                <p>"What would you say to someone who thinks education doesn't matter, or that college is a waste of time and money? " <br>
“We’re sorry Mrs.Parker, you are simply unqualified for the position you applied for. Thank you for your interests, and good luck furthering your job search.” 
	Without an education this is most likely the response you’ll get from any companies or jobs that you are interested in working for. Education is so important, even college. Going to college and obtaining a degree could be the difference between getting that job or getting that call. Many people will say that some jobs don’t need degrees, or a certain level of education, however you may want to work somewhere different in the future. You may even come to find out that you honestly hate the job you thought you wanted to do your entire life. When you’re young you may think you know exactly what you want to do when you are an adult, but anything can be subject to change.
	 Today’s society encourages you to broaden your horizons and keep your options open. When you earn a degree, you are now at an advantage compared to those who don’t have one because you may qualify for a higher position, which means MORE MONEY. 
	Yes, college costs quite a bit of money, still for the amount of money you have the opportunities to make by furthering your education, it wouldn’t seem like that much to you when you have that job making $100,000 a year.
